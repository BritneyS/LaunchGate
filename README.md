LaunchGate makes it easy to let users know if there is a newer version of your
app available.

You can also block access to the app for older versions, which is useful in the
event of a severe bug or security issue that requires users to update the app.

Additionally, you can use LaunchGate to display a remotely configured message to
users at launch which can also be used to temporarily block access to the app
(i.e. during back-end maintenance).
