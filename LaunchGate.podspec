                       LaunchGate makes it easy to let users know if there is a
                       newer version of your app available.

                       You can also block access to the app for older versions,
                       which is useful in the event of a severe bug or security
                       issue that requires users to update the app.

                       Additionally, you can use LaunchGate to display a remotely
                       configured message to users at launch which can also be
                       used to temporarily block access to the app (i.e. during
                       back-end maintenance).
